<p class="message">
  I have always found it difficult to describe myself. Let's just say I have been neurotic about it. Instead let me share the two different versions of the story of me for now.

#### Version ChatGPT
_What I shared with ChatGPT so it can be a better coach and therapist and perhaps the rawest of them all_

>My name is Ju Vern, Ju-Vern or Juvern. I used to care how my given name is stylised but I'm no longer precious about it. My family name is See. I live in the West so I go by the order "given name family name" [order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_name#Name_order). But throughout my childhood in Malaysia, I went by "family name given name".

>I have now lived in London for all my adult life. But I still miss Malaysian food and the tropical weather. I can cook most of the food I miss and pay a limb for those I can't cook as well, but I still haven't been able to solve the issue of the weather.
>
>I feel more Malaysian when I'm in London but less so when I'm in Malaysia. Having only travelled back to Malaysia to see family and friends for many years, I sometimes feel an alien in a country which I hold a passport for.
>
>I dislike being asked what I do for work because I dislike the idea that someone's identity should be tied to their job. I used to say, "I run a consultancy" only because saying "I am an entrepreneur" made me sound like I was too full of myself. When I worked in a startup, I started saying "I work for a software company" because it's as generic as you can get. 
>
>I also don't like the idea of having a career and having to follow a path. During a 1:1 with a manager, I was once asked how the role I was in fit in with my career aspirations. My partner had to put up with my rant aftewards.
>
>My interests are varied and can change a lot. My YouTube suggestions right now are tennis, dog training, K-Pop, K-Drama and BTS which led me to learn Korean. In 2018, I started studying Development Economics but quit after three modules. In 2015, I pondered switching from accountancy to embarking a career in software development.
>
>My main goal is to find myself, whatever that means. Two years ago, I exited the company I co-founded and feel like I'm still in a state of transition. 
>
>My values are a mix of Asian collectivism and Western individualism. I believe in personal freedom and independence but rooted in a sense of responsibility for my family and community. That is why I often feel torn in the choices I make.
>I am really grateful for how my life has turned out. I only have my family to thank for the privileges I've been afforded with and the stability they've given me to pursue the various eccentricities of the path I have chosen. 



#### Version LinkedIn / CV
_The version I find most vomit inducing. It assumes a linear path which puts too much emphasis on where you've worked and what job title you held. There is no room to include any extra curricular activities that tells a fuller picture. I still have a [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juvern/) but I am no longer keeping it up to date._
