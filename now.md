  I have always found it difficult to describe myself. Let's just say I have been neurotic about it. Instead let me share the two different versions of the story of me for now.

It has been six weeks of Zoom free days having left the life of a full-time remote worker behind. Surprisingly, I have been really busy but unintentionally so. Believe it or not, I still haven't found the time to watch the last three episodes of Bridgerton Season 3.

What pays the bills
* Tennis - I have been hitting the courts, either coaching or playing at least three days a week while keeping the operations at the [coaching academy](https://clubspark.lta.org.uk/VamosTennis/) going  
* Dog sitting - I walk and feed dogs and stop them running off to chase cats and squirrels. They get belly rubs but only if they've been a good doggie.

What doesn't pay the bills
* Cooking - I have travelled the world and back with my cooking. From kimchi to quesadillas to any Mary Berry recipes on her cooking shows, I've cooked them all.
* Korean language - 한국어를 잘 못해요
* Life admin - Fixing doors, calling the plumber, washing the dishes, and doing the laundry
* Random - Embracing new experiences. In the last six weeks, I have played a football match for the first time and attended a screenwriting workshop for inspiration. 

Big questions I’m working on answering
* What next - AI, software engineering, PhD, international development, economics, policy, book. The list is endless
* Where next - Continue living in London, moving to Malaysia, splitting our time
* Family - Do we, do we not, when do we?
