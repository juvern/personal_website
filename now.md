  We haven't met for awhile and you want to know what I'm up to right now. Here goes. Inspired by the [Now Page](https://nownownow.com/about).

It has been six weeks of Zoom free days having left the life of a full-time remote worker behind. Surprisingly, I have been really busy but unintentionally so. Believe it or not, I still haven't found the time to watch the last three episodes of Bridgerton Season 3.

What pays the bills
* Tennis - I have been hitting the courts, either coaching or playing at least three days a week while keeping the operations at the [coaching academy](https://clubspark.lta.org.uk/VamosTennis/Coaches) going  
* Dog sitting - I walk and feed dogs and stop them running off to chase cats and squirrels. They get belly rubs but only if they've been a good doggie.

What doesn't pay the bills
* Cooking - I have travelled the world and back with my cooking. From kimchi to quesadillas to any Mary Berry recipes on her cooking shows, I've cooked them all.
* Korean language - 한국어를 잘 못해요
* Life admin - Fixing doors, calling the plumber, washing the dishes, and doing the laundry
* Random - Embracing new experiences. In the last six weeks, I have played a football match for the first time and attended a screenwriting workshop for inspiration. 

Big life questions I’m working on
* What next - AI, software engineering, PhD, international development, economics, policy, writing? 
* Where next - Continue living in London, moving to Malaysia, splitting our time
* Family - Do we, do we not, when do we?
